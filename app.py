# Pseudo code

# ask player to select a level
# create maze based on level
# display maze

#create a loop until game is finished
    # ask player to move mcgyver character (do not allow to move outside maze or on a wall)
    # reload maze with new mcgyver position

    #create condition inside loop
    # if mac gyver move on an item , he fills his bag
    # if mac Gyver faces guardian without all items he looses (game is finished)
    # else he wins (game is finished)


# objects

# maze (attribute is level, method create, method display) -> hint : diplay method should be called after each move
# character (attribute bag, method move)
